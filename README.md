# 🛠️ MeasureMate

Welcome to the `MeasureMate` repository! This Unity project leverages AR Foundation to scan and capture wall faces, estimate measurements, and record device movement. Additionally, it allows users to measure the distance between two pieces of furniture in a room. It's designed specifically for Android devices.

## 🌟 Features

- 📏 **Wall Scanning**: Detect and scan wall surfaces using AR Foundation.
- 📐 **Measurement Tool**: Utilize a ruler algorithm to measure distances on the scanned wall.
- 🛋️ **Furniture Distance Measurement**: Measure the distance between two pieces of furniture, such as a bed and a bedside table.
- 📱 **Motion Capture**: Record device movement with accelerometer and gyroscope data.
